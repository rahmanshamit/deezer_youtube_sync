# deezer_youtube_sync
Trying to make it easy for me to sync my Deezer favorites to a Youtube playlist, that will help with two things:
1. I can keep my favorites synced on both Youtube and Deezer.
2. Deezer is not as popular as Spotify (yet!), so this makes it easy to share my playlist with friends!
